# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a Etch-A-Sketch game created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.    

# Aim of the Project

The main aim of the project was to get more experienced in using these three programming languages to get prepared for more advanced
lessons [in the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
At the moment there are two main features of the project:
1. Being able to select grid sizes from 2x2 to 100x100 size grids
2. Reset to get a clean slate
